                                HOW TO INSTALL:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As WebGL has some domain-restriction policies to restrict the loading of
    textures:

    In order to run this demo, you need to install a web server in you machine
    (or copy the code of this demo in a web server).


    1) Open Google Chrome web browser.


    2) In the address bar, write this:

                            web server for chrome


    3) Press ENTER and the webpage of "web server for chrome" web store will be
       loaded.


    4) Press "Install" button in order to install this extension.


    5) Press "Start App" and a small floating panel will appear (maybe it will
       appear below the window of your web browser).


    6) In the floating panel, press "Choose Folder":

        Select the directory where you downloaded and uncompressed the
        "webgl_parallax_mapping_demo".


    7) In the web browser visit the url written in the floating panel, in my case
       it was:

                        http://127.0.0.1:8887/index.html

    8) And the demo will appear :-)
